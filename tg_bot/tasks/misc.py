HELP_ANSWER_TEXT = """Welcome to the bot, {full_name}!

This bot is designed for *free access* to various neural models, including:
- Document processing
- Image generation
- Text response generation
- And much more

*Text Generation*
Send messages and receive responses.
Each conversation step is saved in the model's memory, allowing for continuous dialogue.
If you reply to the model's message using `reply`, the model will receive the narrowed conversation context up to that step.

*Analysis of Attached Documents and Photos*
Works on the principle of regular _text generation_.
Simply attach your file or photo and add a task description.

*Image Generation*
Use the `/image` command to start a separate dialogue thread specifically for image creation.

*Web Search*
The `/web_search` command will add a network search flag to your next text query.
The model will also consider your dialogue context, just like in regular _text generation_.

*Other Commands*
- `/reset` - clear the dialogue from the model's memory
- `/personal_settings` - customize the bot for your needs

Currently, the bot is under development, and many features are unavailable..."""
